  We have five core values promoting the bringing together of people of all walks of life to enjoy the Bay Area in a unique way from the water.Â&nbsp; Our community includes rowers with their families and friends, as well as officials and volunteers. 
Our activities include practices and training, races, the development of rules and procedures, and celebrations.<p></p>
<p align="left">Our <em>Overarching Values</em> are <strong>Safety</strong> and <strong>Fairness</strong>. Our <em>People Values</em> are <strong>Inclusivity</strong>, <strong>Community</strong> and <strong>Fun</strong>.</p>
